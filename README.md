# The good count

**[Side project]** A little game managing basic calculation to train your math skills !

This is an ersatz of the well known game, made with Python and the pygame library.

I made this game from scratch, without any A-to-Z tutorial to train my python skills.

All assets are homemade, even the final BO music made with FL studio.
