# The good count
[Side project] A little game managing basic calculation to train your math skills !

This is an ersatz of the well known game, made with Python and the pygame library.

I made this game from scratch, without any A to Z tuto to train my python skills.

All assets are homemade, even the final BO music made with FL studio.

In order to play it at home, you can download this zip file => [The good count](https://github.com/Zararthustra/The_good_count/raw/main/The_good_count_folder.zip)

Here is a quick tutorial:
